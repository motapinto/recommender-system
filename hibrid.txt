Hybrid recommenders ----
- Stacking URM, ICM, UCM
- Combine models with same structure (all item based similaruty models)
- Combine models with different structure (user based, item based and matrix factorization)
- Combine models with different loss functions (ranking vs rating prediction)
- Which models performs better for a certain category of users (interactions)

Stacking
- concatenate URM and ICM and have a stack URM and stack ICM
- we can plug all icm together or choose which pair combines better
- weights in matrixes can become hyper-parameter
- apply weights in some matrixes have zero effect in some models
- Warning: some icms have garbage
- which users to include in the calcualtion of the similarity using feature weighting (treat users has features)

Combine models with same structure (parameters have same mearning)
- For example two user based, item based models
- More difficult in matrix factorization (not used normally)
- Simplest solution: weighted average (solutions are better for weihted avreage between 2 models)
- Normalization can be required is order of magnitude is very different
- Value range can be very different between models with different structure
